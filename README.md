# Clustering - Segmenting Mall Customer
To cluster mall customers, I conducted two unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-Means and DBScan) in R using Kaggle dataset [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
## Introduction
Clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques. The data can be divided on the basis of centroids (K-Means), densities (DBScan), etc. Thus, in this project, I applied K-Means and DBScan these two clustering methods to find customer segments in the mall.
